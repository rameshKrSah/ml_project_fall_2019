# Human Activity Recognition Using Recurrent Neural Network

For the class project, I decided to compare the performance of recurrent neural network with convolutional neural
networks for human activity recognition. 

You can find the Python codes in the code directory and some results files in the report directory. You need to have
TensorFlow version 2.x installed to run the codes.
