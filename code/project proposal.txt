# Title : Human Activity Recognition using Recurrent Neural Network

# My research as a Ph.D. student involves working with sensor data to design and build 
algorithms for health care. In the class today I was intriguied by the temporal property of RNN 
algorithms which considers the data value at time t-1 when assessing the data value at time t. 
This led me to think about using RNN for human activity classification because the time series data
from different sensor also has temporal component in it. 

Specifically, I want to use a RNN algorithm for human activity classification and compare its 
performance with other machine learning techniques such as CNN and DNN. Also, if I have time left
I would also want to explore the idea of adversarial examples in the context of RNN.
